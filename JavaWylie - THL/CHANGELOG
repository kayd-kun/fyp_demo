2010-03-01: improve space handling in toWylie, to turn spaces judiciously into '_', [  ] or 
	    leave them as spaces, depending on escape mode and context.
2010-02-27: move the helper classes into nested classes, to avoid having so many files around; 
	    change the API so that warnings are passed along in the same call to toWylie() or 
	    fromWylie(), rather than getting stored on the object.  this makes the object pretty 
	    much stateless and shareable between threads.
2010-02-26: port the "unicode to wylie" code from perl, and associated test suite bits
2010-02-05: java improvements; move class intialization to a static block; port test suite from perl
2010-02-03: first shot: learn enough java, port the "wylie to unicode" code from perl
